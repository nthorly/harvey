### To Run Locally...
<br><br>
Because we are making http calls to load javascript files you need to have a web server running.
<br><br>
To spin up a simple webserver run
```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```
in your terminal in the root directory of the project and then open a browser and navigate to
```localhost:8000```.
<br><br>
### Troubleshooting
<br><br>
The above webserver command will only work if you have Python installed. Most mac/linux systems have this by default.
<br><br>
Is python installed?
Run ```python``` in Windows or ```python -V``` in mac/linux. If it is not installed you will see ```'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.```
To install python follow the steps [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download). After you install python you should be able to follow the steps above in the ```To Run Locally``` section.
