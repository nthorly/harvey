    <h3>Andy Cruz</h3>
    <p>
        I'm on my final semester of my undergrad majoring in GIS, with a minor in geology.
        I'm excited for graduation and will remain working at Apple until I find a position as a GIS Analyst backin Houston.
        I plan to return for my masters after a couple of years in the field.

    <h3>Abdullatif Alyaqout</h3>
    <p>
        I’m a 2nd year Master of Science Student at the Geography Department, Texas State University.
        I received my Bachelor of Art in Geography from Kuwait, where I’m from. I’m interested in
        Maps and Cartography in general, and how to explore spatial data through Geovisualization and
        using Geovisual Analytics. I’m currently focusing on visualizing social media and
        crowdsourced data for mapping inundation surfaces caused by flood events.

        collected from eye tracking devices can be improved through the application of
        game-design elements and principles.
